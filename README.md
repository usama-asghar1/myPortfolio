# My Portfolio

I decided to use Next.js for this app because, after learning React, this felt like a natural next step. Benefits to react include to reduce latency and increase performance due to server-side rendering. Routing pages was also easier to code. Tailwind CSS went hand in hand with Next and I took advantage of the animations and used it on my components. 

## Getting Started
