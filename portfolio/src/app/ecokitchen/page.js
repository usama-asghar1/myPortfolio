                Ecokitchen is a project that I worked on with a team of 4 other students. The goal of the project was to create a website that would allow users to search for recipes based on the ingredients they have in their kitchen. The website would also allow users to create an account and save recipes to their profile. The website was created using React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. The website was deployed using Heroku.

            <h2>My Contributions</h2>
            <br></br>
            <p>
                My main contributions to the project were the login and registration pages, the user profile page, and the recipe page. I also helped with the styling of the website.

            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <br></br>
            <p>
                The main challenge I faced was learning how to use React. I had never used React before this project, so I had to learn how to use it while also working on the project. I also had to learn how to use MongoDB and Heroku, as I had never used them before.

            <h2>What I Learned</h2>
            <br></br>
            <p>
                I learned how to use React, MongoDB, and Heroku. I also learned how to work in a team and how to use GitHub to collaborate with others.
